T1	Title 0 145	Assignment of the bacterial agent of urinary calculus in young rats by the comparative sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of corynebacteria.
T2	Paragraph 146 939	Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to assign four isolates of spontaneous urinary calculus in young laboratory rats. The phylogenetic relationships among the rat isolates and selected species of corynebacteria were also inferred. Based on the homology and evolutionary distance analysis, the 16S rRNA genes of the rat isolates were almost identical with that of Corynebacterium renale ATCC 19412. Also the results of the phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship among the isolates and C. renale, but they were clearly different from C. pilosum, C. cystitidis, C. kutscheri and Rhodococcus equi. The results of the present study and previously published biochemical data demonstrate that the organism involving urinary infections in young rats is identified to be C. renale.
