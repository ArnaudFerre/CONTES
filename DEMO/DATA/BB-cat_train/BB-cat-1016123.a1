T1	Title 0 141	An evaluation of selective broths based on the bi-selenite ion and on hypertonic strontium chloride in Salmonellae detection in egg products.
T2	Paragraph 142 579	Of the 104 isolations of Salmonella sp. from egg pulp, 97 were obtained from strontium chloride M broth, 42 from strontium selenite broth and 57 from strontium selenite A broth. The results suggest that the first medium may be used more successfully than bi-selenite based media for enrichment and subsequent detection of salmonellae in egg products; however, the growth of S. pullorum was not satisfactory in strontium chloride M broth.
