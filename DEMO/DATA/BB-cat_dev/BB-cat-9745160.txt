New one-week, low-dose triple therapy for the treatment of duodenal ulcer with Helicobacter pylori infection.
Antimicrobial therapy is the recommended treatment for duodenal ulcer associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. The eradication of bismuth-based triple therapy with bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole and amoxicillin is limited by low compliance, drug resistance and side-effects. Two-week proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy has a higher eradication rate but is costly. This study was designed to compare the efficacy, patient compliance and cost of short-term PPI-based triple therapy with those of bismuth-based triple therapy.
Ninety patients with active duodenal ulcer disease and H pylori infection, proven with the 13C-urea breath test and CLO test (Campylobacter-like organism test) were treated randomly in three therapeutic groups: Group A, DeNol 120 mg, amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg four times a day orally for 14 days; Group B, omeprazole 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and amoxicillin 500 mg four times a day for 14 days; Group C, omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for seven days. Nizatidine 150 mg twice a day was given continuously following the end of anti-H pylori therapy for each group. Two months later, endoscopy, the CLO test and 13C-urea breath test were repeated to assess the eradication rate of H pylori and the ulcer-healing rate. Drug tolerance was evaluated by patients themselves by daily recording of any side-effects.
Eighty-four patients completed the entire course of therapy and evaluation for H pylori infection. The H pylori eradication rates in Groups A, B and C were 75% (21/28), 93% (26/28) and 89% (25/28), respectively (p = 0.466). The ulcer healing rate was 86% (24/28) in Group A and 89% (25/28) in Groups B and C (p = 0.764). A total of 74 patients (88%) were free from symptoms at the end of the triple therapy. Symptom relief was faster in patients with PPI-based triple therapy (Groups B and C) (days 3 and 4) than for patients with bismuth-based triple therapy (day 5). The cost of Group C therapy was lower than that for Groups A and B. There were no major side-effects in any of the patients.
One-week triple therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole is highly effected for the eradication of H pylori. A therapeutic regime of one week's duration with lower cost, good compliance and mild side-effects may offer a good choice for treatment of duodenal ulcer associated with H pylori infection in clinical practice.
