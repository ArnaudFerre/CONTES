Contents
--------

  ** `.txt' files: each file contains the text contents of a document. Each document is a PubMed abstract (including the title) about bacteria. The `.txt' files are encoded in UTF-8. The name of the files follow the pattern:

        BB-cat-PMID.txt

     where PMID is the PubMed identifier of the abstract.

  ** `.a1' files: for each document, the corresponding `.a1' file contains the text-bound entities manually annotated. In this task the text-bound entities are given as input and will not be predicted. The annotations are expressed using the BioNLP-ST format (http://2013.bionlp-st.org/file-formats). The BB-cat annotation schema (http://2016.bionlp-st.org/tasks/bb3) defines two entity types: Bateria and Habitat. Like in the `.txt' file, the surface form control is encoded in UTF-8. The unit of text-bound entity offsets are characters (and not bytes); UTF-8 multibyte characters (like characers with diacritics) count as one. `.a1' files also contain entities of type Title and Paragraph that indicate respectively the title of the abstract and each paragraph of the abstract.

  ** `.a2' files: for each document, the corresponding `.a2' file contains the attachment of each text-bound entity to their referential. In this task referential attachments are the target result and must be predicted. The attachments are expressed using the BioNLP-ST format (http://2013.bionlp-st.org/file-formats) as normalizations. For Bacteria entities, the referential is the NCBI Taxonomy. For Habitat entities, the referential is the OntoBiotope ontology. Both can be found on the Bacteria Biotopes page.
