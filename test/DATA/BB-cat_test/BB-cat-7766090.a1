T1	Title 0 100	Mitomycin C stimulates thermally induced recombinant gene expression in Escherichia coli MC strains.
T2	Paragraph 101 646	The effects of mitomycin C on C1857-controlled recombinant gene expression have been explored in E. coli cultures when the drug was added simultaneously to the thermal induction. A significantly improved yield of homologous, heterologous and chimeric fusion proteins was observed in E. coli MC1061 and GE864 (a MC4100 derivative) thermoinduced cells. This feature was not detected in other E. coli strains and does not involve a gene dosage mechanism but a strain-dependent stimulation of gene expression unrelated to the RecA protease activity.
