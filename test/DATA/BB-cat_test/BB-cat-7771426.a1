T1	Title 0 107	Low dose, short-term triple therapy for cure of Helicobacter pylori infection and healing of peptic ulcers.
T2	Paragraph 108 312	The aim of this study was to confirm the efficacy and tolerability of a new, low dose, short-term triple therapy for cure of Helicobacter pylori infection, as suggested by Bazzoli, in a larger population.
T3	Paragraph 313 705	On an "intention-to-treat" basis, 116 patients with active (n = 41) or healed (n = 47) peptic ulcer disease or ulcer-like dyspepsia (n = 28) and H. pylori infection received a 1-wk course of omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., clarythromycin 250 mg b.i.d., and tinidazole 500 mg b.i.d.. Four weeks after treatment withdrawal, cure of H. pylori infection was evaluated by rapid urease test and histology.
T4	Paragraph 706 1055	One hundred and sixteen patients returned for follow-up. In 108 patients, H. pylori could not be identified 4 wk after cessation of therapy. The eradication rate was calculated to 93%. In addition, all patients with active peptic ulcers showed complete healing at follow-up despite no further treatment. Drug acceptance and compliance was excellent.
T5	Paragraph 1056 1402	Triple therapy as suggested by Bazzoli with omeprazole (in this study given b.i.d. for better compliance), clarythromycin, and tinidazole is indeed highly effective for both cure of H. pylori infection and for healing of peptic ulcers, is easy to perform, is cheap, and is without clinically significant side effects, even in a larger population.
