T1	Title 0 88	Dexamethasone in the treatment of experimental Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis.
T2	Paragraph 89 1343	A model of experimental lapin meningitis was used to assess the effect of meningeal inflammation caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b on development of brain edema, increase in intracranial pressure, and production of brain lactate. Four treatments were assessed: dexamethasone alone, dexamethasone plus ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone alone, and no treatment. The brain water content in untreated rabbits with meningitis was 419 +/- 10 g of H2O/100g of dry weight after 29 hr of infection (vs. 405 +/- 14 in uninfected rabbits; P less than .05). In rabbits treated with dexamethasone, dexamethasone plus ceftriaxone, or ceftriaxone alone, these values were 404 +/- 12, 406 +/- 12, and 411 +/- 14 g, respectively (P greater than .05). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and lactate levels were significantly increased in all animals during the 24 hr of meningeal inflammation (P less than .005), and these levels were comparably reduced after 9 hr of treatment. Although the values for brain water content, CSF pressure, and lactate concentrations in infected animals treated with ceftriaxone plus dexamethasone were not significantly different from those in animals treated with ceftriaxone alone, the values were consistently lower in the former group.
